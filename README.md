# Bank-Marketing-Data
I created a classification model to predict wether clients would subscribe to a term deposit for banks.
This information can be used to help banks better market to individuals who are more likely to subscribe to a term deposit.
The most import features were determined to be age, last contact duration, average yearly balance, days after contact from the previous campaign, number of contacts during the campaign, and the number of previous contacts before the current campaign.
Models were generated using Random Forest, KNN, and Gradient Boosting. It was determined that Gradient Boosting was the most effective model.
Some future goals for this project are to create predictive models using XG Boosting and ADA Boosting to see how these methods compare to Gradient Boosting.
